							<p>Now, you have your fresh new tattoo, and you want to take good care of it! I’ve taken a lot of time and 
							effort to make sure you leave my shop with a really beautiful tattoo, which can turn into a disaster if the 
							proper aftercare is not taken. So please read this and follow these steps to keeping it that way!</p>

				<div id="aftercarePageText">
				<p>Leave that cling film alone! I covered up your new tattoo for a very good reason - to keep air-born bacteria from 
					invading your wound .Yes, as pretty as your new tattoo is, it is still a open wound. Leave on for a minimum of two hours.
Take cling film off. REMEMBER; never touch your tattoo unless you have just washed your hands! Now gently wash away any ointment, blood and/or 
plasma and completely clean the area. Do not use a washcloth or anything abrasive. Make sure to wash your new tattoo several times a day with a 
non-scented, antibacterial soap. (If your tattoo feels slimy and slippery, you have probably been oozing plasma. Try to gently remove as much of 
this as possible - when the plasma dries on the skin surface, it creates scabs.)  Then pat (do not rub) the area firmly with a CLEAN towel or paper towel to get it completely dry.</p>
​<p>After washing the tattoo make sure you apply a very light application of HUSTLE BUTTER, I have personally had good results with this product, 
so has everybody else that uses it. Check it out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hustlebutter/timeline?ref=page_internal">here.</a>
No matter what your friends may tell you to use, DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PRODUCT. I give away HUSTLE BUTTER with every tattoo, it's not cheap and is 
classed as one of the best products at the moment. As expensive as it maybe, it is an amazing product and it means your tattoo gets the best aftercare 
money can buy. If you run out please feel free to pop into the shop and get some more. It is not available in any shops over here. If I have tattooed you 
at a convention or you have travelled to the shop, please call and I will happily post more to you. Apply hustle butter 5 or 6 times a day for the first 
three days, especially when you feel the tattoo is dry. Keeping it moisturized will ensure the least amount of scabbing and peeling, thereby reducing the 
fading of the colour. If your tattoo is shaded, it will heal 20% lighter.</p> 

<p>Do not swim, soak in a hot tub or bath for two weeks after getting your tattoo. Chemicals like chlorine will cause the tattoo to fade and/or an infection. 
Soaking the tattoo will also cause the scab to come off faster, and along with it, some of the ink</p>
<p>Do not tan for at least 30 days after tattooing to allow it to heal. When healed you can lie in the sun or go to the tanner as long as you put a light layer 
of SPF 45 or higher sun block over the tattoo. Sunlight will fade the ink, especially in bright colours or black. If you expose it to too much sun, you might end up 
having to get it redone to restore colour. Like any other wound to the skin, your tattoo will itch during the healing process. If it starts to go spotty apply less 
hustle butter. Continue this process until the tattoo is healed, and remember, don’t pick, peal or scratch any scabbing or hard layers.  These hard layers are normal 
and picking them off could damage or remove colour.</p>

<h4>Long-Term Aftercare</h4>
<p>Long-term aftercare is just as important as short-term.  The more you care about how you treat your skin, the longer your tattoo will uphold its sheen.</p>
<p>1. Your tattoos will lighten up after they have fully healed.  That’s normal as the layers of skin are growing back over the ink and accepting it within your skin.  
But to keep a solid colouring, always make sure to put on sunscreen when going outside, especially in the summer. SPF 45 or higher and sunscreen for children are always great 
at protecting your skin and several tattoo aftercare brands make sun blocks designed for tattoos.</p>
<p>2. Always keep your tattoos moisturized, especially in areas prone to fading like hands, feet, elbows, etc.  This will help keep the tattoo in tact longer and less prone to fading over the years.</p>
<p>You pay a lot for a quality tattoo, so treat it like the fine piece of art that it is and make it last! I guarantee my work and if any bits haven’t healed right or need touching 
up please feel free to get in touch as I want you to be 100% happy with your gorgeous piece of art. </p>
